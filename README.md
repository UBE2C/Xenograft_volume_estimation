## Description
This repository contains the scripts written to estimate the tumor volumes based on caliper measurements.
This repo is specifically created for the COMIX project, however if the tools are working as hoped another repo might be published with more generalized scripts.


##NOTE
Please feel free to check the scripts, fork them and contribute as you see fit :).
